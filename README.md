_Assignment reflection_

I think I met the basic requirements and the first three stretch goals. My site doesn't look as good as the SpaceY site, or work as well, but I missed a lot of the CSS on Tue/Wed and I've only just caught up in time to make a submission by the deadline, so I've not been able to look in depth at the things I couldn't do. I felt I'd learn more at this point from adding more features that aren't perfect, rather than trying to fix up the ones that do (mostly) work. I didn't attempt the social media icons. I could't figure out how to overcome autoplay blocking (doubtless I could turn it off at my end, but that doesn't help whoever visits the site), so I had to play the background music muted.

I seem to have a lot of very similar style blocks, for example: "header, nav", "nav" and "header nav". It doesn't feel very tidy. It works, but is this really the right way?

I compared my code to the SpaceY page at the end and I noticed something odd: In my code, the SpaceRR text is inside my header nav block, but at SpaceY, they're siblings. How would it be on the same line then? I tried moving mine to the same place, and it then displays above the nav bar on the page, as I'd expect. But the SpaceY one doesn't. I scratched my head for ages and couldn't see how. But I've only started this very late as I had to catch up from when I fell behind on Tue/Wed, so I've had to rush through it and maybe I'm missing something obvious, perhaps to do with position properties?
